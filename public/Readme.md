usage: ./dynCGOL (file.seed) (number of ticks) (rows) (collumns)

	dynCGOL will only work if the inputed rows and collumns are the same as the file of the size inputed.
	Else the program will shut down.

	All command line arguments should be typed, else the program will not work.

	to start, type Y or y when asked.
	
	after program is over, if user types Y or y to continue, the program will repeat the same number of 		ticks, continuing from where the program left off.
	if answer is no, program will shut down.


	UPDATE FOR PORTFOLIO - removed the input text requirement - all arguments are hardcoded - changed program slightly to work better as a background
